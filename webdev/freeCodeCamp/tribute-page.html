            <p>Royal Navy Commander James Bond, CMG, RNVR, is a fictional character created in 1953 by British journalist and novelist Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections</p>
            <p>The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2018, there have been twenty-four films in the EON Productions series.</p>
            <p>There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball).</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></span> Bond is not a hero, nor is he depicted as being very likable or admirable. He is a Secret Service Agent. He’s not a bad man, but he is ruthless and self-indulgent. He enjoys the fight- he also enjoys the prizes. In fiction people used to have blood in their veins. Nowadays they have pond water. My books are just out of step. But then so are all the people who read them.”</p>
            <p>“I didn’t intend for Bond to be likable. He’s a blunt instrument in the hands of the government. He’s got vices and few perceptible virtues.”</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">James Bond Actors</h2>

        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>Sean Connery</dt>
            <dd>Sean Connery was the first actor to perform the role on the big screen. He appeared in Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and Diamonds Are Forever (1971). In 1983 he returned to the role for the last time in the unofficial James Bond film, Never Say Never Again. In addition he also provided his voice and likeness for 2005's video game adaptation of From Russia with Love.</dd>
            <dt>George Lazenby</dt>
            <dd>Australian actor and model George Lazenby briefly held the role from 1968 to 1969, appearing in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Even though he had been offered a contract for seven movies, Lazenby felt dissatisfied with the role and left the series after the release of the film.</dd>
            <dt>Roger Moore</dt>
            <dd>Following the final departure of Sean Connery in 1971, English actor Roger Moore took over the role from 1973 to 1985. To date he is the longest-serving James Bond actor, spanning twelve years in the role. He is also the oldest actor to play Bond; having begun the role at 45 and retiring from it at the age of 58.

            <dt>Timothy Dalton</dt>
            <dd>Welsh actor Timothy Dalton took over the role from Roger Moore in 1987. He appeared in The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989). Legal issues between the Bond producers and the studio over distribution rights resulted in the cancellation of a proposed third Dalton film scheduled for release in 1991 and put the series on a hiatus for several years.</dd>

            <dd>Irish actor Pierce Brosnan held the role from 1995 to 2004. He appeared in GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). In addition he also provided his likeness for six James Bond video games, starting with Rareware's 1997 blockbuster GoldenEye 007. Although he didn't voice the character until Everything or Nothing, his last appearance as 007, several actors have lent their voices to Brosnan's Bond, including Adam Blackwood in Tomorrow Never Dies (1999), Timothy Bentinck in The World Is Not Enough (2000) and later Maxwell Caulfield in Nightfire (2002).</dd>
            <dt>Daniel Craig</dt>
